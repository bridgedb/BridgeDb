#This is an example rdfConfig.txt file with the default values in it.
#To set your own file copy this file for example to $CATALINA_HOME/conf/OPS-IMS and edit it there.
#Ideally point Environment variable OPS-IMS-CONFIG to the folder containing your config files.

#BaseURI should match the localing the war will be propped to or links will not work.
BaseURI                 http://localhost:8080/OPS-IMS/

#WARNING leaving the default relative links is not recommeneded especially for Main and Load RDF.
#Relative links will fail if loading and running is not done from the same directory.
#Remember that the parent directies (in the defaults ../rdf) MUST exist.
#Remember to grant READ and WRITE ACCESS to all users running any bridgedb programs including tomcat.

#Main RDF store
SailNativeStore         ../rdf/linksets

#Load RDF Store
#This give the option of having a seperate load database to reload all data while he service stays live.
#Note: You will have to stop start the service (or drop in a new war) after swapping load and production servers
LoadSailNativeStore     ../rdf/linksets
#Defaults to SailNativeStore if not set

#Test RDF store
#WARNING do not set the test store to be the same as the production store as one of the tests erases the store!
#the default relative directory will use the RDF directory directly below $BridgeDB
TestSailNativeStore     ../rdf/testLinksets

#Warning you will also need a sqlConfig.txt file
