#This is an example sqlConfig.txt file with the default values in it.
#To set your own file copy this file for example to $CATALINA_HOME/conf/OPS-IMS and edit it there.
#Ideally point Environment variable OPS-IMS-CONFIG to the folder containing your config files.

SqlPort             jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306
SqlDatabase         ims
SqlUser             ims
SqlPassword         ims


#Load SQL Database (OPTIONAL)
#This give the option of having a separate load database to reload all data while the service stays live.
#Note: You will have to stop start the service (or drop in a new war) after swapping load and production servers
LoadSqlDatabase     ims
     #Defaults to SqlDatabase if not set
#Load Database should have the same user as production database so they can be swapped.

#Test user may be the same but having a different users adds security

TestSqlDatabase     imstest
TestSqlUser         imstest
    #Defaults to SqlUser if not set
TestSqlPassword     imstest
