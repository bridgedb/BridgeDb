<b>BridgeDb</b> is a java library intended for dealing with identifiers for
biological entities such as genes, proteins, metabolites.
<p>
In BridgeDb, a {@link org.bridgedb.DataSource} defines an online resource such as Ensembl or Entrez.
<p>
An {@link org.bridgedb.Xref} is the combination of an identifier and a particular resource, 
and thus uniquely defines a single biological entity. It is often possible
to generate a URL to an online description of this biological entity.
<p>
Identifiers are preferably not descriptive. A descriptive name such as INSR (Insulin Receptor) 
instead of Entrez Gene 3643 can be useful. In BridgeDb we refer to this as a Symbol. Because
of the ambiguous nature, Symbols are not the primary means for identifying 
<p>
Usually, different DataSources describe the same biological entities. Cross references are
stored in so called Synonym databases. {@link org.bridgedb.IDMapper} has facilities for mapping cross-references
and mapping between different DataSources.
